# Moviefax

Moviefax is a movie data lookup app that returns simple data as well as purchase, streaming and rental sources. I am currently working on a login module that will allow you to build a custom list of favorite movies. Eventually, I will build a function to have the app suggest to you movies you haven't seen based on this list. Check on my progress under 'projects' [here](https://alicecutler.dev/).

Dependencies: axios, body-parser, dotenv, express, fs, path, request, sass, url, nodemon

This project uses a gitignored config.env file with the following variables: PORT, IMDB_API_KEY, and WATCHMODE_API_KEY- when running the code, you will need api keys for imdb.com and watchmode.com.
